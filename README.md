# 🧠 StoreMind

**Never forget what to buy.**

StoreMind is a clean, fast, store-based shopping reminder app built with Flutter.

Instead of messy generic lists, StoreMind lets you assign items to specific stores — so when you're at Lidl, Kaufland, IKEA, or any store, you instantly see what you need.
